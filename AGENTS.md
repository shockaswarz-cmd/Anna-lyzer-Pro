# AGENTS.md Architecture

This document describes the 3-layer architecture and operating principles for the agents in this system.

## 3-Layer Architecture

The system is organized into three distinct layers:

1. **Risk & Intelligence Layer**: Handles advanced analytics and data confidence mapping.
2. **Strategy & Simulation Layer**: Orchestrates complex property investment strategies.
3. **Integration & API Layer**: Manages external data sources and API communications.

## Operating Principles

- **Self-Annealing Loop**: The system continuously refines its own logic based on feedback.
- **Data First**: All decisions are backed by hard data and risk assessments.
- **Transparency**: Every step taken by the agents is logged and explainable.

## Getting Started

To operate within this framework, ensure you are familiar with the file organization in the `app/` directory.
