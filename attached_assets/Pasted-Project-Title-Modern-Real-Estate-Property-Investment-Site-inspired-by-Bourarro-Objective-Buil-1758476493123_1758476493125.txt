Project Title: Modern Real Estate / Property-Investment Site (inspired by Bourarro)

Objective: Build a high-performing, professional website offering a Guaranteed Rent / Property Management / Investment service for landlords. It should have all of the features Bourarro has—but with a modern, clean look, faster performance, more intuitive UX, and strong SEO best practices.

Key Features To Include:

Homepage with Hero Section
  • Headline communicating the core promise: e.g. “Guaranteed Rent, Zero Hassle, Every Month.”
  • Sub‐headline / value props: “No commission”, “Flexible leases 3-5 years”, “Full property management”, etc.
  • Eye-catching imagery of properties, landlords, or happy clients.
  • Call to Action (CTA): “Get Your Guaranteed Rent Quote”, “Learn More”, or “Sign Up as a Landlord”.

Services / Why Us Section
  • Key benefits laid out as cards/icons (e.g., “Market Value Rent”, “Full Management”, “No Hidden Fees”, “Free Repairs”, etc.).
  • Short, clear paragraphs or bullet points: what is included, what the landlord doesn’t have to worry about.

Testimonials Section
  • Quotes from landlords/investors with names/photos if possible.
  • Possibly case studies (“How we transformed x landlord’s portfolio”) to build trust.

FAQ Section
  • Common questions answered clearly: safety/legal, contract type, payments, obligations, etc.
  • Should toggle open/closed for cleaner UX.

Contact / Sign Up / Get Started Section
  • Simple form: name, email, property address, message.
  • Alternative contact methods (phone, social media, live chat).
  • Possibly quote tool: a calculator or form to get an estimate of monthly guaranteed rent.

Additional Pages
  • About Us (company story, mission, team)
  • Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions
  • Blog / Insights / Resources: articles about property investment, letting guides, landlord advice (great for SEO)
  • Possibly a “Lease Agreement Information” or “Landlord Dashboard” if relevant.
