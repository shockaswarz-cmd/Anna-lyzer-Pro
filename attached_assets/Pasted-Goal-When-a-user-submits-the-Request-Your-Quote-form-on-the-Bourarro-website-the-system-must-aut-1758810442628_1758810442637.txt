Auto-Generated Calculations & Insights

Estimated Market Rent: Pull live or recent comparable rental data (Rightmove/Zoopla API or UK property data) for the specific postcode and property type.

Estimated Property Value: Provide a rough market value estimate based on location, size, and recent sales comparables.

Serviced Accommodation Profitability:
• Estimate nightly/weekly serviced-accommodation rates in the area
• Factor in occupancy rates and operating costs to project monthly/annual net revenue
• Indicate suitability (e.g., “Good candidate for serviced accommodation” or “Low demand area”)

Suggested Rent-to-Rent Offer: Based on market rent and projected serviced-accommodation revenue, calculate a fair guaranteed rent range we can offer (e.g., “Recommended offer: £X – £Y per month”).

Technical Requirements:
• Integrate a property data API (e.g., Zoopla, Rightmove, or Land Registry) for rent and value estimates.
• Use a simple algorithm to calculate serviced-accommodation projections (average nightly rate × estimated occupancy – costs).
• All calculations must be performed server-side for security and speed.
• Ensure email is formatted in a clean, professional HTML template and sent instantly upon form submission.
• Store the request and calculations in the site’s admin panel for future reference.

Outcome:
Every time a visitor requests a quote, Info@bourarroproperties.co.uk
 receives a single, well-formatted email containing the property details, estimated market rent, property value, serviced-accommodation profitability, and a suggested guaranteed-rent offer—so the Bourarro team can respond quickly with a fair, data-driven proposal.
