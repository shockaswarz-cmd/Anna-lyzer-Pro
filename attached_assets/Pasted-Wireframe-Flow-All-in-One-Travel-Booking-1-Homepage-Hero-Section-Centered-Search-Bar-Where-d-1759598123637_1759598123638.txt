Prompt for AI Web Builder (with Wireframe Specs)

Build an all-in-one travel booking flow with the following:

Homepage with search bar + date selector → leads to AI results.

Results Page showing hotels, flights, activities (editable).

Itinerary Sidebar on the right with daily breakdown, edit/delete buttons, sticky checkout + save buttons.

Checkout screen with transparent cost breakdown and 2.2% booking fee.

Saved Trips area for later bookings.

Entire layout must be responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Sidebar should be tall, proportional, and touch the top of the screen without overlapping hero elements.

All elements must be visible without scrolling on standard screen sizes.

Do you want me to actually sketch/draw a wireframe mockup for you (boxes and layout diagrams), so you can show your AI builder a visual blueprint of the flow?
