Prompt: Seamless All-in-One Travel Booking with Search + Itinerary Checkout

Objective: Build a seamless all-in-one booking system where users can type a destination into the search bar, instantly generate a complete trip (flights, hotels, activities), and pay for everything directly from the itinerary sidebar.

User Flow:

Search Bar Input

User types in where they want to go (city, landmark, event, hotel, restaurant, or excursion).

Prompt the user to select travel dates (departure & return).

Dates must be required to ensure accurate pricing for flights and hotels.

AI Trip Generation

AI automatically finds and displays:

Flights (best routes, times, and prices)

Hotels/Accommodation (quality, ratings, and price range)

Activities/Excursions (tours, events, restaurants, festivals, attractions)

All elements are pre-loaded into the Itinerary Sidebar.

Itinerary Sidebar Features

Daily itinerary view shows flights, accommodation, and planned activities.

User can:

Add or remove activities

Edit details (change hotel, swap flight, replace excursion)

View cost breakdown per item (flights, hotel nights, activities)

A visible Checkout button at the bottom lets the user book the entire trip in one transaction.

A secondary Save Itinerary button allows saving for later.

Checkout & Payment

The entire trip is bookable in one seamless payment.

System displays a transparent cost summary:

Flights cost

Hotel cost

Activities cost

+ 2.2% booking fee added to the total trip cost

Payment processed securely through integrated gateway (Stripe/PayPal etc.).

User Experience Goals:

Entire booking journey should feel seamless: from search → itinerary → checkout.

No need to visit multiple booking pages.

All components (flights, hotels, activities) are integrated and editable in one itinerary.

Technical Requirements:

Integrate APIs for flights, hotels, events, tours, and restaurants.

AI engine should optimise results based on: price, quality, ratings, and user preferences.

Sidebar must be responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Ensure booking data syncs automatically between the search results, itinerary, and checkout.

Outcome:
A frictionless all-in-one travel booking platform where the user enters a destination + dates, receives a complete pre-built trip, edits if needed, and books everything at once directly from the itinerary sidebar.
