BOURARRO PROPERTIES WEBSITE - DETAILED OVERVIEW

This is a property investment and management platform designed for UK landlords.

================================================================================
CORE BUSINESS SERVICE: GUARANTEED RENT
================================================================================

The main offering is a guaranteed rent scheme where Bourarro Properties:

- Leases properties from landlords for 3-5 years
- Pays the landlord a fixed monthly rent (around 85% of market rate) regardless of whether tenants are in place
- Takes 0% commission - the landlord gets consistent income with no fees
- Handles everything - tenant sourcing, property maintenance, legal compliance, and day-to-day management

This eliminates the landlord's risk of void periods, late payments, and tenant issues.
